These programs are for help in converting TDF and XML files to JSON frame
configurations.
   However they may not work in all cases and the output may need manual edits.

XML files with SensorGroups with multiple Sensors are not handled corectly.

The xml for some suna are missing the final 1 byte 'bu' status field.
framer needs that field.

Framer should use 'constants' to handle the seafet slope and offset.

The xml converter doesn't use stdout. It writes new files itself.
The names of the files go to stdout.

The frame and field delimiters in xml don't always get converted
properly. There is some bug which sometimes converts to "\\x0..."
  The output conf should be checked by hand for proper
\t, \r, \n or their unicode names.
